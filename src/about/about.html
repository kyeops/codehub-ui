          <h3>ITS CodeHub</h3>
          <p class="text-section-color-blue">
              Reuse, Transform, Innovate
            </p>
          <p class="usa-intro">
              ITS CodeHub is the source code management (SCM) system for the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO). It is an open and secure ecosystem for the ITS community to discover reusable software code, technical documents, configuration files, and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            ITS CodeHub promotes a reuse-first mentality. The system puts code directly in the hands of developers to customize, transform, expand, and improve, as trends evolve and needs change.
          </p>
          <p>
            ITS CodeHub leverages open-source and collaborative development and innovative software development frameworks, such as the Agile approach to software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach has the benefits of lowering costs, increasing interoperability and transparency, and accelerating the path to high-quality software deployment—collectively advancing our nation’s transportation system.
          </p>

          <h3>The Purpose</h2>
          <p class="text-section-color-blue">
            Empower innovation through code reuse, collaboration, and continuous improvement in the open...
          </p>
          <p>
              ITS CodeHub's primary objectives are to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Source development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encourage code reuse.
            </li>
            <li>
              Foster open-source collaboration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support the development of high-quality and well-tested source code.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Capabilities</h3>
          <p class="text-section-color-blue">
              More than just a catalogue of software development projects...
          </p>
          <p>
            As an SCM system, ITS CodeHub goes beyond cataloging U.S. DOT-funded software development projects. It is a gateway to a wide range of resources that transform the business of ITS software development with federal funds, integrating it with the movement toward open source.
          </p>
          <p>
            ITS CodeHub offers the transportation community the following capabilities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Discover</strong> projects and modules already built within the U.S. DOT and across the open-source community (code.gov, Public GitHub, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Evaluate</strong> code health, statistics, dependencies, and compatibility to reuse in projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Connect</strong> to developers and others who have reused and extended code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Extend</strong> development of prototypes and proof of concepts through open collaboration and crowdsourcing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analyze</strong> development trends and statistics to understand evolving software development needs.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Community</h3>
          <p class="text-section-color-blue">
            Working together to drive the development and transformation of innovative technologies...
          </p>
          <p>
            The community plays a pivotal role in the development of open-source products—from discovery, to quality assurance, to coding and development, to adoption and integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            ITS CodeHub fosters a community for the grassroots, collaborative development of open-source ITS software among the U.S. DOT, state and local agencies, researchers, and companies.
          </p>
