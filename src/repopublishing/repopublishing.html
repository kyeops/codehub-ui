                    <h2>Repository Registration</h2>
                    <p>ITS CodeHub is committed to providing the ITS community access to the most relevant and useful U.S. DOT source code repositories.  Users are able to customize, transform, expand, and improve applications, as trends evolve and needs change.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Our primary goal is to ensure that these repositories are of the highest quality, including code readability and maintainability. In support of this effort, we have assembled a repository template for organizations who wish to make their repositories discoverable on ITS CodeHub (See Below).</p>
                    <p class="text-align-center"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/usdot-jpo-codehub/codehub-readme-template">Repository Template</a> <img src="img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon"></p>
                    <p><strong>Does your repository(s) match this template and would your organization like it made discoverable on ITS CodeHub? The following three steps will guide you through the registration process.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>For more information, please contact the ITS JPO Data Program support team at <a id="dontact-us-email" href="mailto:data.itsjpo@dot.gov">data.itsjpo@dot.gov</a>.</p>
                        
                    <h3>Step 1: Registration</h3>   
                    <p>Begin the onboarding process by downloading and submitting <a target="_blank" href="https://its-datafiles.s3.amazonaws.com/codehub-registration-form.docx">Repository Registration Form</a> <img src="img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon"> via email to <a id="dontact-us-email" href="mailto:data.itsjpo@dot.gov">data.itsjpo@dot.gov</a>.</p> 
                    <h3>Step 2: Registration Form Review</h3>
                    <p>Upon receipt of the <a target="_blank" href="https://its-datafiles.s3.amazonaws.com/codehub-registration-form.docx">Repository Registration form</a> <img src="img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon">, the ITS JPO Data Program support team will begin a check to ensure all information required from the developer is provided in order to complete ITS CodeHub registration. </p>
                    <p>During this phase, the developer’s repositories will be checked for compliance against ITS CodeHub’s <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/usdot-jpo-codehub/codehub-readme-template">Repository Template</a> <img src="img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon">.</p>
                    <p>Should your repository fail any checks, you will be requested to fix them prior to ingestion.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Repository Ingestion</h3>
                    <p>When the ITS JPO Data Program support team has determined that the repository(s) contains all required information, the ingestion process can begin.</p>
                    <p>During ingestion, the health of your repository(s) will be reviewed, for viruses and code quality (maintainability, reliability, and security). ITS JPO Data Program support team will contact you if your repository(s) requires additional updates.</p>
                    <p>Once ingested, the repository(s) will be discoverable within ITS CodehHub, including its health status and badge. See the About Badges within the Resource section of ITS CodeHub for more information.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Deprecation</h3>
                    <p>Users that wish to remove their source code from the ITS CodeHub should contact <strong>the ITS JPO Data Program support team at <a id="dontact-us-email" href="mailto:data.itsjpo@dot.gov">data.itsjpo@dot.gov</a>.</strong></p>
