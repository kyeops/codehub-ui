                    <h2>Make Your Code Discoverable!</h2>
                    <p>ITS CodeHub is committed to providing the ITS community access to the most relevant and useful source code repositories allowing users to customize, transform, expand, and improve applications, as trends evolve and needs change.</p> 
                    <p>Benefits of registering your code on ITS CodeHub include:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Enhancing your own code</strong> by opening it up to the ITS community and code contributions</li>
                            <li><strong>Advancing ITS research</strong> by making your code available to other ITS researchers who can use it to propel forward other research projects</li>
                            <li><strong>Achieving cost savings</strong> by preventing rework by other ITS projects for existing ITS code</li>
                            <li><strong>Increasing speed to delivery</strong> by opening up your code to other developer and researcher contributions</li>
                            <li><strong>Engaging with the ITS research community</strong> to build your own ITS research network and increase ITS collaboration</li>

                    </p>

                    <p>ITS CodeHub promotes open source development and best practices. We are happy to work with you to figure out how ITS CodeHub can best support your project. Contact <a id="dontact-us-email" href="mailto:data.itsjpo@dot.gov">data.itsjpo@dot.gov</a> for additional information or support.</p>
                    <p class="text-align-center"><em><strong>See below for how to make your code available on the ITS CodeHub!</strong></em></p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 1: Registration</h3>
                    <p>Register your code to be made available in ITS CodeHub by downloading and submitting the <a target="_blank" href="https://its-datafiles.s3.amazonaws.com/codehub-registration-form.docx">Repository Registration Form</a> <img src="img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon"> via email to <a id="dontact-us-email" href="mailto:data.itsjpo@dot.gov">data.itsjpo@dot.gov</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 2: Registration Form Submission Review</h3>
                    <p>Upon receipt of the <a target="_blank" href="https://its-datafiles.s3.amazonaws.com/codehub-registration-form.docx">Repository Registration Form</a> <img src="img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon">, the ITS CodeHub support team will check to ensure all information required from the developer is provided.</p>
                    <p>During this phase, the ITS CodeHub support team will also check the repository(ies) for compliance against ITS CodeHubâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/usdot-jpo-codehub/codehub-readme-template">Repository Template</a> <img src="img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon">.</p>
                    <p>Should your repository fail any checks, you will be requested to fix them prior to ingestion.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Make Your Repository Discoverable</h3>
                    <p>When the ITS CodeHub support team determines that the repository contains all required information, it will be made discoverable (or searchable) on ITS CodeHub.</p>
                    <p>While making the repository discoverable, the health of the repository will be reviewed for viruses and code quality (e.g. maintainability, reliability, and security). The ITS CodeHub support team will contact the developer if the repository requires additional updates.</p>

                    <h3>Deprecation</h3>
                    <p>Users that wish to remove their source code from the ITS CodeHub should contact <strong>the ITS JPO Data Program support team at <a id="dontact-us-email" href="mailto:data.itsjpo@dot.gov">data.itsjpo@dot.gov</a>.</strong></p>
