    "body": "## General Notes\r\n\r\nAfter numerous months with many volunteers pitching in their skills to further Cockatrice, we're pleased to announce the newest official release; <kbd>**Cockatrice: The Shadows**</kbd>! We hope you enjoy the changes made, and we have listed all changes since the last Revision of Cockatrice was released, with their corresponding ticket(s), for your convenience.\r\n\r\nIf you ever encounter a bug, have a suggestion or idea, or feel a need for a developer to look into something, please feel free to [open a ticket](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/issues). ([How to create a GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/How-to-Create-a-GitHub-Ticket))\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to help contribute to Cockatrice in anyway, [check out our README](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice#get-involved-). We're always available to answer questions you may have on how the program works.\r\n\r\n## Upgrading Cockatrice\r\n\r\n:warning: Due to a change in BinTray API, the auto-updater on \"Cockatrice: Gatewatchers\" (Released February 2nd, 2016) and versions of Cockatrice through May 9th, 2016 will not work properly. We have pushed a fix for the auto-updater and hope to allow you to use it in the future.\r\n\r\nTo update your client to \"Cockatrice: The Shadows\" go to our BinTray or download at the bottom of these release notes.\r\n\r\n:warning: If you use Mac OS X 10.8 or earlier, you will need to upgrade your OS as Cockatrice will only compile on Mac OS X 10.9 and newer\r\n\r\n:warning: If you use Windows Vista or earlier, you will need to update your operating system as we no longer support those versions of Windows.\r\n\r\nPlease re-run <kbd>Oracle</kbd> after upgrading your client. Some of the changes made require additional information added to your <kbd>cards.xml</kbd> database, which will be automatically added once you run the program.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Notable Changes\r\n- Card database now progressively loads to avoid excessive CPU usage. #1859 \r\n  - Will also alert user if  the database is corrupt and how to install a new one\r\n  - Ability to edit sets/tokens outside of deck editor\r\n  - User created tokens saved to a different file to prevent overwrites by Oracle\r\n- Permissive loading of XMLs (fixes bug with tokens not working properly on older clients). #1901 \r\n- Can now use <kbd>!setnumber!</kbd> in custom download URLs. #1921 \r\n- Client uses gender neutral text to avoid excessive translations. #1949 \r\n\r\n### User Interface\r\n- Create game dialog bug fixes. #1794\r\n- Import your own XML databases with ease. #1796 \r\n- Shortcut menu corrections. #1799 \r\n- Game tabs will save their custom sizes as defined by the user. #1807 \r\n- Token creation dialog will now have P/T view-able without scrolling over. #1877 \r\n- Remove all elements of price generation. #1880 \r\n- Card mention in chat bug fixes. #1920 \r\n- Card popup size fixed based on client dimensions. #1930 \r\n- About menu link changes. #1949 \r\n\r\n### Translations\r\n- **Fully translated**\r\n  - English\r\n  - German\r\n  - Italian\r\n  - French\r\n- Above **90%** translated\r\n  - Spanish\r\n  - Japanese\r\n- Above **50%** translated\r\n  - Korean\r\n  - Russian\r\n  - Polish\r\n  - Portuguese\r\n- Below **50%** translated\r\n  - Swedish\r\n  - Chinese\r\n  - Dutch\r\n- [**Help us Translate Cockatrice into your native language!**](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Translation-FAQ)\r\n\r\n### Deck Editor\r\n- Deck viewer will save custom column sizes and layouts. #1900 \r\n\r\n### Under the Hood\r\n- Replay maintenance scripts updated. #1803 \r\n- Change MySQL schema to Innodb over MyIsam. #1808 \r\n- Windows XP still ~somewhat~ supported through custom compiling. #1819 \r\n- Linux 64-bit custom compiling fixes. #1828 \r\n- Sounds and Themes are now stored within the Cockatrice app. #1832 \r\n- Crash fixes for moderator notifications. #1834 \r\n- Prevent notifications from crashing user. #1866 \r\n- Unique ClientID generation to prevent cross server clashing. #1894 \r\n- \"New sets found\" dialog bug fixes. #1944 \r\n- Fix auto-updater for Bintray API #1974 \r\n\r\n### Servatrice\r\n- Two new options; <kbd>requireemail</kbd> and <kbd>requireemailaction</kbd> for verification. #1873 \r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\n\r\nWe continue to find it amazing that so many people contribute their time, knowledge, code, testing and more to the project. We'd like to thank the entire Cockatrice community for their efforts, and we'd like to especially recognize @ctrlaltca @zebington @tooomm @woogerboy21 @leematos @ZeldaZach and @Daenyth for their continued support of Cockatrice development.

A specific list is here: #97. Please add unmentioned issues in that ticket.\n- The translations are going to be out of date\n- Some set codes have changed from the new source, which means that card images might need to be redownloaded. **If you are under bandwidth caps** you are highly encouraged to manually correct these to avoid downloading card images you already have. See #114 for specifics. This note can be ignored by most people because Cockatrice will automatically download the images again. \n- If you downloaded or compiled a prerelease version of the client you should rerun Oracle.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nAll the people who have contributed their time, knowledge, code, testing to the project. The project wouldn't be nearly as vibrant as it is now without all your help. Special thanks (in no particular order) to @woogerboy21, @VanNostrand, @ctrlaltca, @DMBuce, @mattkelly, and @sylvan-basilisk!\n\n## Future Roadmap\n\nTickets for the release after this one can be watched on [the issue page](https://github.com/Daenyth/Cockatrice/issues?direction=desc&milestone=2&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)\n\n## Specific Changelog\n\n[Git shortlog](https://gist.github.com/Daenyth/2151dfe586ff71ea04ce)\n"
